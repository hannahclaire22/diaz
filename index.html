        <p style="font-size: 25px">What Is Architecture?</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">Architecture is a multifaceted discipline that involves the planning, designing, and construction of buildings and other structures. It is both a science and an art, bringing together technical knowledge, creative skills, and an understanding of the human experience in the built environment. Architects are professionals trained in the field of architecture, and they play a key role in shaping the physical world around us.</p>
